# Quaternions: The Byproduct of Vector Multiplication

In our journey to unravel the enigma of vector multiplication, we stumbled upon a fascinating byproduct: quaternions. These four-dimensional mathematical objects emerged as a result of multiplying 3D vectors, and they hold the key to understanding rotations in three-dimensional space.

## The Emergence of Quaternions

Recall that when we multiplied two 3D vectors, we obtained an expression with familiar components: the dot product and the cross product. However, we also encountered three mysterious terms: $yz$, $zx$, and $xy$. These terms, known as bivectors, form the basis of quaternions.

<Steps>
### Step 1

Recognize the pattern in the mysterious terms:

- $yz$ represents the plane formed by the $y$ and $z$ axes
- $zx$ represents the plane formed by the $z$ and $x$ axes
- $xy$ represents the plane formed by the $x$ and $y$ axes

### Step 2

Understand the algebraic behavior of these terms:

- Squaring any of these terms yields -1: $yz^2 = zx^2 = xy^2 = -1$
- Multiplying these terms in a cyclic manner yields the same result: $yz \cdot zx \cdot xy = -1$

</Steps>

This behavior is precisely the definition of quaternions, often written as:

$$i^2 = j^2 = k^2 = ijk = -1$$

where $i$, $j$, and $k$ represent the bivectors $yz$, $zx$, and $xy$, respectively.

## The Structure of Quaternions

A quaternion $q$ can be expressed as a linear combination of a scalar (real) part and three bivector (imaginary) parts:

$$q = w + xi + yj + zk$$

where $w$, $x$, $y$, and $z$ are real numbers.

Quaternions are an extension of complex numbers, with three imaginary components instead of one. They form a four-dimensional algebra that is closed under multiplication, just like complex numbers.

## Quaternions and Rotations

The most significant application of quaternions in game development and computer graphics is their ability to represent rotations in 3D space. When we multiply two unit vectors (vectors with a length of 1) using the rules of quaternion multiplication, the resulting quaternion represents a rotation.

The angle of rotation is twice the angle between the two vectors, and the plane of rotation is the plane formed by the two vectors.

<Callout type="warning">
It's important to note that quaternions are not commutative under multiplication, meaning that the order of multiplication matters. This property is essential when working with rotations in 3D space.

By understanding quaternions as the byproduct of vector multiplication, we gain a deeper insight into their structure and behavior. This knowledge empowers us to harness the power of quaternions in various applications, such as [representing orientations](/bivectors-and-geometric-algebra/multivectors-in-2d-and-3d), [interpolating rotations](/conclusion), and more.

As we continue our exploration of geometric algebra, we'll uncover even more profound connections between vectors, bivectors, and the elegant mathematical framework that underlies them.
