# Introduction

Welcome to our deep dive into the fascinating world of vector multiplication and geometric algebra! In this talk, we'll explore the fundamental question: **Why can't you multiply vectors?** Along the way, we'll unravel the enigmatic concepts of complex numbers, quaternions, and bivectors, and discover how they relate to game development and mathematics.

Our speaker, Freya Holm√©r, is an independent game developer and educator with a passion for bridging the gap between math and programming. With experience in various aspects of game development, from environment art to level design and programming, Freya has recently focused on the mathematical foundations that underlie our games.

We'll start by reviewing the basics of vectors and various vector products, such as the dot product, cross product, and Hadamard product. This will lay the groundwork for our exploration of number systems and their properties, including closure under different operations.

Next, we'll draw parallels between complex numbers and 2D vectors, setting the stage for our attempt to multiply vectors directly. As we examine the resulting algebraic structure, we'll encounter a divine axiom that will guide us through the rest of our journey.

From this axiom, we'll derive the dot product and cross product, and discover quaternions as the byproduct of multiplying 3D vectors. We'll then introduce bivectors, oriented planes that play a crucial role in geometric algebra, and explore their applications in simplifying concepts like curvature.

By the end of this talk, you'll have gained valuable insights into the world of geometric algebra and its implications for game development and mathematics education. So, let's dive in and unravel the enigma of vector multiplication together!
