# Multiplying Vectors: The Journey Begins

After reviewing vector basics and exploring the fascinating world of complex numbers, it's time to dive into the heart of the matter: multiplying vectors. In this section, we'll attempt to multiply vectors directly and unravel the enigmatic algebraic structure that emerges.

## The Setup

Let's consider two arbitrary 3D vectors, $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$, expressed in terms of their components and basis vectors:

$\mathbf{a} = a_x\mathbf{x} + a_y\mathbf{y} + a_z\mathbf{z}$
$\mathbf{b} = b_x\mathbf{x} + b_y\mathbf{y} + b_z\mathbf{z}$

Our goal is to multiply these vectors together, without any dot products, cross products, or other predefined operations. We want to uncover the fundamental nature of vector multiplication.

## Multiplying Vectors

<Steps>

### Step 1: Multiply the vectors
Let's multiply $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$ together:

$\mathbf{a}\mathbf{b} = (a_x\mathbf{x} + a_y\mathbf{y} + a_z\mathbf{z})(b_x\mathbf{x} + b_y\mathbf{y} + b_z\mathbf{z})$

### Step 2: Expand the multiplication
Distribute the terms:

$\mathbf{a}\mathbf{b} = a_xb_x\mathbf{xx} + a_xb_y\mathbf{xy} + a_xb_z\mathbf{xz} + a_yb_x\mathbf{yx} + a_yb_y\mathbf{yy} + a_yb_z\mathbf{yz} + a_zb_x\mathbf{zx} + a_zb_y\mathbf{zy} + a_zb_z\mathbf{zz}$

</Steps>

The result is a collection of curious terms, such as $\mathbf{xx}$, $\mathbf{xy}$, and $\mathbf{yz}$. These are not vectors in the traditional sense, and their meaning is not immediately apparent.

At this point, it might seem like we've hit a dead end. The result doesn't resemble any familiar vector or scalar quantity. But fear not! This is just the beginning of our journey.
