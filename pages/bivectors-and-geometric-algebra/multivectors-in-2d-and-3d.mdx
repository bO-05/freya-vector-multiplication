# Multivectors in 2D and 3D

In geometric algebra, we combine scalars, vectors, and bivectors into a single structure called a **multivector**. This unified framework allows us to perform algebraic operations on these different geometric objects seamlessly.

## 2D Multivectors

In 2D, a multivector consists of:
- A scalar (real number)
- A vector (with 2 components)
- A bivector (with 1 component)

We can represent a 2D multivector as follows:

$\text{Multivector}_{2D} = s + \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{B}$

where:
- $s$ is the scalar part
- $\mathbf{v} = v_x\mathbf{e}_x + v_y\mathbf{e}_y$ is the vector part
- $\mathbf{B} = b_{xy}\mathbf{e}_{xy}$ is the bivector part

<Callout type="info">
The basis elements for a 2D multivector are:
- Scalar: 1
- Vector: $\mathbf{e}_x$, $\mathbf{e}_y$
- Bivector: $\mathbf{e}_{xy}$
</Callout>

## 3D Multivectors

In 3D, a multivector consists of:
- A scalar (real number)
- A vector (with 3 components)
- A bivector (with 3 components)
- A trivector (with 1 component, representing the unit volume)

We can represent a 3D multivector as follows:

$\text{Multivector}_{3D} = s + \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{B} + \mathbf{T}$

where:
- $s$ is the scalar part
- $\mathbf{v} = v_x\mathbf{e}_x + v_y\mathbf{e}_y + v_z\mathbf{e}_z$ is the vector part
- $\mathbf{B} = b_{yz}\mathbf{e}_{yz} + b_{zx}\mathbf{e}_{zx} + b_{xy}\mathbf{e}_{xy}$ is the bivector part
- $\mathbf{T} = t_{xyz}\mathbf{e}_{xyz}$ is the trivector part

<Callout type="info">
The basis elements for a 3D multivector are:
- Scalar: 1
- Vector: $\mathbf{e}_x$, $\mathbf{e}_y$, $\mathbf{e}_z$
- Bivector: $\mathbf{e}_{yz}$, $\mathbf{e}_{zx}$, $\mathbf{e}_{xy}$
- Trivector: $\mathbf{e}_{xyz}$

By using multivectors, we can unify various geometric concepts and operations within a single algebraic framework. This allows us to simplify and generalize many mathematical concepts, such as [rotations](/bivectors-and-geometric-algebra/the-wedge-product), [curvature](/bivectors-and-geometric-algebra/curvature-bivector), and more.

Multivectors provide a powerful and elegant way to represent and manipulate geometric objects in any dimension, making geometric algebra a valuable tool for game development, physics simulations, and computer graphics.
